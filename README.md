# Visualforce in Lightning Experience

Session by Mike Senn for Dreamforce 2017 - Contact me on Twitter @mpsenn

So you want to move to Lightning, but you don't know what to do about your customized Visualforce pages. In this session, you'll learn best practices and tips for getting Visualforce pages to “just work” in Lightning Experience. In addition, you'll also see how to easily style your Visualforce pages with the look of Lightning Experience.

This repo contains sample code and the slides from my session.
